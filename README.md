# filter_scratchblocks

Display Scratch code blocks as SVG. Use {scratchblocks}{/scratchblocks} for block code blocks or {scratchblocksinline}{/scratchblocksinline} for inline code blocks.

By default, this filter only renders code blocks in English. However, the site admin can provide a translation file and specify supported languages on the filter setting page.

Based on scratchblocks: http://scratchblocks.github.io/.
